# Introduction
As a personal project, timeStamp serves as a sandbox for honing programming skills, particularly in Java. The primary focus is on developing a functional time tracker application that enables users to record and monitor their tasks efficiently.

# Features

The timeStamp app is currently in the early stages of development and only has a few basic features implemented. These include:

- new GUI with JavaFX ðŸŽ‰
  - **Task Management:** Add, edit, and delete tasks to keep track of your activities.
  - **Working Stopwatch:** Start and stop a stopwatch to record the duration of your tasks.
  - **Data Persistence:** Tasks, tags and time entries are saved in a database for future use.

These features are initially planned to be implemented in the course of development:

- **Task Tracking:** Record tasks and activities, including start and end times, to keep track of how you spend your time.
- **Project Management:** Organize tasks into projects, allowing you to categorize and manage related activities.
- **Reports and Statistics:** Generate reports and view statistics to analyze time usage and identify patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Enjoy a clean and intuitive user interface for a seamless experience.

Please note that the feature list may expand as the project evolves and more functionalities are implemented.

# Technologies
The timeStamp app is developed using Java, utilizing its robust object-oriented programming capabilities. It may incorporate additional libraries or frameworks to enhance functionality.
For the user interface, JavaFX is used to create a clean and intuitive GUI.

Its using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for saving data.
